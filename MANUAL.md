## 📜 INTRODUCTION
Welcome, traveler. You have successfully accessed the MASH (Mythic Assembly & Sigil Heuristics) Operating System installer. This manual provides the necessary runes and rituals to provision your station safely.

## 🚀 INSTALLATION RITUAL
To summon the installer directly from the cloud forge, execute the following incantation:

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drtweak86/Mash-installer/main/install.sh)
```

## 🛠️ OPERATIONAL MODES
The installer supports multiple operational depths:

1. **MINIMAL**: Core runes only. Essential for light reconnaissance.
2. **DEVELOPER**: Full forge suite. Includes Rust, Docker, and shell polish.
3. **ARCHIVE**: Complete system data. The whole enchilada.

## 🖱️ STATION CONTROLS (TUI)
- **NUMERIC (1-9)**: Direct command selection.
- **ENTER**: Confirm and proceed to next station.
- **ESC / C**: Manual override or return to previous buffer.
- **Q**: Emergency abort and return to shell.

## 📼 TELEMETRY & LOGS
Every strike of the pickaxe is recorded. If the system panics, consult the black box:
- **STDOUT**: Real-time events in the station cockpit.
- **FILE**: `~/mash-install.log` (Persistent historical ledger).

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING (KISS PRINCIPLE)
If you encounter a **HALTED** status:
1. **WHAT**: Read the `ERROR` line.
2. **WHERE**: Check `~/mash-install.log` for the deep traces.
3. **FIX**: Follow the `FIX` suggestion provided by the station.

## 🏛️ DISTRO EQUALITY
MASH recognizes the following guilds as first-class citizens:
- **ARCH LINUX**: The mountain dwelling tinkerers.
- **DEBIAN / UBUNTU**: The ancient guardians of stability.
- **FEDORA**: The forward-looking scouts.
