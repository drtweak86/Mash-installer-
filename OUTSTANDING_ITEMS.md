# 📜 The Bard's Quest Log
> **Current Chapter**: PR #15 — The Neon Signal and the Sudo Sigil 🍺

## ✅ Completed Quests (The Ledger is Ink-Stained)
- **Sudo Password Module**: Added the `sudo_password` runic storage for thread-safe password handling. 🛡️
- **Keepalive Pipework**: Re-routed the `sudo` keepalive to use pipes instead of inheriting the terminal stdin. No more crashing in the neon rain! 🛠️
- **README Runes**: Updated the sacred scrolls with notes on the sudo password ritual. 📜
- **Green Forge**: All code formatted, clippy warnings silenced, and all 99 tests are green as mithril! 🟢

## 📋 Active Quests (The Dragon Stirs)
- **Sudo TUI Integration**: Implementing the actual password prompt screen in the Ratatui interface. The cockpit needs a new panel! 🔮
- **Asterisk Masking**: Ensuring the runes are hidden as they're typed. No peeking, you rogue! 👁️
- **Password Cleanup**: Adding the final rite to clear the memory once the forge is cool. 🧹

## 🔜 Future Shafts (Deep Mining Ahead)
- **Pi OS 64-bit Test**: Testing the new runes on the official Raspberry Pi scrolls. 🥧
- **Arch aarch64 Test**: Taking the installer to the Arch mountains for a durability check. 🏔️
- **Incorrect Password Handling**: Teaching the forge how to handle a dwarf who forgot his own name (or password). 🍻

## 📝 Tavern Notes
- *“The infrastructure is ready, the pipes are laid, and the forge is humming. We just need to paint the menu!”* — Bard
- *“Don’t forget to clear the memory, else the dragon might sniff the passwords.”* — Random Drunk Dwarf

**Status**: READY FOR MERGE ✅ (The ledger is signed and the tankard is empty.)
