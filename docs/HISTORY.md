### 🛡️ 14th of Frostmoon, Year of the Rusting Gear
**Location: The Whispering Anvil, Neon District**

The first runes were etched today. I sat by the hearth, the terminal’s orange glow dancing in my beard. We pried apart the monolith, and D-03 sat patient inside the `PhaseRunner`. We taught a thousand dwarves to sing one dry-run chant: `run_or_record()`. It was a long night, and the ale was cold, but the foundation is solid. I yanked the rogue `if dry_run` from the code, and the forge snickered—one gate to rule them all, no duplicates allowed! ⚒️

### 🔮 2nd of Spark-Tide, Year of the Plasma Rails
**Location: The Iron Tankard, Sector 7**

Phase 2 is a long ballad, and the `runner` and `registry` finally know their stanzas. `PhaseContext` sang metadata today, and the `InstallationReport` turned into a choir that the CLI could finally hear. I spent most of the day teaching the Pi detection helpers to recognize their own kin. *“Is it a Pi? Which generation? Does it worship USB 3.0?”* They answered with a hum. I whispered to the margins that there’s no place like `127.0.0.1`. 🥧

### 🐉 21st of Deep-Winter, Year of the Digital Dragon
**Location: The Sleeping Drake Tavern, Pi Mountains**

The Dragon stirred today. Phase 3 rose from the forge with four new weapons: mount options that whisper `noatime` to spinning platters, and swap configs that place the overflow file on the HDD where it belongs! No more fragile SD cards for this dwarf. I tuned the kernel parameters until the `vm.swappiness` was just right. The dragon didn’t breathe fire—it breathed `sysctl -w`. And I approved with a hearty toast! 🍺🔥

### 🛡️ 4th of Spring-Thaw, Year of the Gilded Sigil
**Location: The High-Vault, Mythic Assembly HQ**

The forge is sealed against the neon rain! I added the `InstallerLock` today—an exclusive, non-blocking grip that keeps the forge honest. Try to run two installers at once and you’ll bounce off like a blunt axe on mithril. I also hardened the TLS paths—every `curl` now carries the sacred `--proto '=https' --tlsv1.2` sigil. The neon rain can pound all it wants; the vault is secure. 🛡️🌧️

### 📡 20th of High-Sun, Year of the Ratatui Ritual
**Location: The Neon Tavern, Forge District**

The Ratatui cockpit is live! The old `indicatif` bars have melted away, replaced by a 4-pane cyberpunk layout that hums with telemetry. I spent the afternoon painting the neon telemetry pane—CPU, RAM, and fake network chatter to keep the dwarves entertained while the installer works. Failures now exit via a neon error epilog that highlights the phase context. It’s beautiful, like a sunset over a silicon valley. 🔮✨

### 🍺 21st of High-Sun, Year of the Ratatui Ritual (Today)
**Location: The Bard's BBS, Sector 9**

Today I gave the entire ledger a "Glowup". The README is clean and technical, the reports are consolidated, and the Quest Log is whimsical as a drunk dwarf on pay-day! I’m preparing to push the changes to the `main` branch. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast—ancient dwarven knowledge, and it’s never failed me yet. One more dram before the final commit... 🍺⚒️
