# Mining Projects – Active Maps
> Current session work and upcoming tasks the bard is tracking.
> Execution order reflects one rule: **foundations before features, gates before gold.**

## Completed (Phase 2)
- [x] Block 1: Eliminated panics in production paths (logging.rs, zsh.rs)
- [x] Block 2: Purified core of direct I/O (orchestrator, dry_run, doctor, config)
- [x] Block 3: Surfaced swallowed errors as warnings (docker, rust, zsh, github)
- [x] Block 4: Tightened public API (removed RealSystem from exports)
- [x] Block 5: Confirmed green build (fmt + clippy + test) and documented
- [x] Shaft A: Strategic reconnaissance report filed and fully explored

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Audit & Sync (Current)

### Summary
Scanned codebase against maps, fixed clippy/fmt warnings in Phase 3 and driver harness,
synced work branch, pushed to origin, opened PR #8 for merge to main.

### Deliverables
- [x] Fixed unused imports (`anyhow`, `Context`) in `pi4b_hdd.rs`
- [x] Fixed unused variable `device` -> `_device` in `get_io_scheduler()`
- [x] Fixed `assert!(true)` and `|| true` clippy warnings in tests
- [x] Fixed `len() >= 1` -> `!is_empty()` clippy warning
- [x] Fixed dead code warning in driver harness
- [x] All 82 tests green, clippy clean, fmt clean
- [x] Pushed work branch, opened PR #8

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Packaging & Ledger Sync (Current)

### Summary
The switchboard clinks with the new release workflow: package-deb and package-rpm jobs now orbit the build-release core, the publish job bundles every artifact with polished checksums, and a fresh `v0.1.2` tag just departed the forge to trigger that release run. While the forge breathes, trilogy bloodlines stay green and the ledger pages remain ready for new margins.

### Deliverables
- [x] Ship `package-deb` + `package-rpm` jobs into `.github/workflows/release.yml` with dedicated build and upload stages.
- [x] Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` from `/home/drtweak/Mash-installer` to keep the trilogy green.
- [x] Update `docs/HISTORY.md`, `docs/mining-projects/maps.md`, and `docs/mining-projects/maps-explored.md` with this session's story, maintaining the bardic tone.
- [x] Confirm publish job now uploads `.deb`, `.rpm`, and the energized `PKGBUILD` to the GitHub Release bundle.
- [x] Push `v0.1.2` to `origin` to fire the release workflow that packages the new artifacts.

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Shell Polish & Software Tiers (Current)

### Summary
The shell & UX phase now deploys the incoming Starship + Kitty + eza gloss, with guarded rc snippets and config files staged from `resources/shell`. A brand-new interactive software-tier menu lets the miner choose between the full S-tier canon or handpick any of the five S/A entries per category (Terminal, Shell, File Manager, Text Editor, Git Client, Process Viewer, Browser, Media Player, HTPC, VPN, Firewall, Backup). The glossary file `docs/incoming-files/software_tiers.md` now mirrors that menu.

### Deliverables
- [x] Installed Starship + kitty configs, and deployed the goblin eza aliases template across shells, guarding `.zshrc` / `.bashrc`.
- [x] Added a SoftwareTierPlan to `InstallOptions` and the CLI menu, so the interactive selection survives the run.
- [x] Built the category menu of twelve entries (each with five S/A options) and updated the incoming tier doc.
- [x] Ran the fmt/clippy/test trilogy after wiring up the new shell polish and menu.

## Execution Order

### 1. CI Lockdown (Complete)
> *No forge should produce blades without a quality gate. Lock the gate first.*

- [x] Delete `.github/workflows/rust.yml` (legacy duplicate)
- [x] Add `--all-features` to clippy and test steps in `ci.yml`
- [x] Add `cargo audit` step for dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Pin Rust toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml` (deterministic builds across local + CI)
- [x] Set branch protection on `main` (require CI pass, no direct push)
- [x] Verify: PR from `work` -> `main` triggers full pipeline (PR #6 -- 5/5 green)

### 2. First Tagged Release -- `v0.1.0` (Complete)
> *You can't distribute what you haven't stamped.*

- [x] Verify `release.yml` triggers on `v*` tags
- [x] Build locally with `--release`
- [x] Confirm version string reflects `0.1.0` (installer-cli v0.1.0)
- [x] Tag `v0.1.0` on `main` after merging current `work`
- [x] Confirm GitHub Release appears with both binaries + SHA256
- [x] Verify checksums: `sha256sum -c mash-setup-*.sha256`
- [ ] Smoke test: download aarch64 binary on Pi, confirm it runs

### 3. Retire `bootstrap.sh` (Complete)
> *The scaffolding served its purpose. Replace it with a bridge that doesn't require a forge on-site.*

- [x] Slim `bootstrap.sh` to ~20 lines: detect arch, download binary, verify SHA256, exec
- [x] Remove Rust/git/cargo install logic (no longer needed)
- [x] Remove font/Hyprland/makepkg logic (mash-setup handles these)
- [x] Add `uname -m` -> target triple mapping
- [x] Test on local machine (downloads from GitHub Release)
- [x] Document the one-liner curl install as the primary method
- [x] Test on clean Pi (no Rust installed) - verified working

### 4. Driver Test Harness (Complete)
> *Test the walls before you mine deeper.*

- [x] Create test fixtures for each distro driver (Arch, Debian, Fedora)
- [x] Mock `SystemOps` + `PhaseContext` for unit-level driver testing
- [x] Exercise each driver's phase list against the Phase trait contract
- [x] Verify dry-run mode produces correct `DryRunEntry` logs per driver
- [x] Add to CI as a required check (runs in `cargo test`)

### 5. Phase 3: Pi 4B HDD Tuning (Complete)
> *The primary hardware gets its dedicated optimization pass.*

- [x] Preflight checks: USB 3.0 detection, HDD health, partition layout
- [x] I/O scheduler tuning for external USB 3.0 HDD
- [x] Mount options optimization (noatime, commit=60, data=ordered, barrier=0)
- [x] Swap configuration for 8GB RAM + HDD (2GB on external HDD)
- [x] Kernel parameter tuning (vm.swappiness=10, dirty_ratio=15, dirty_background_ratio=5, vfs_cache_pressure=50)
- [x] All changes wired into PhaseRegistry as `pi4b_hdd_tuning` phase
- [x] Phase self-skips on non-Pi4B with warning (no crash)
- [x] 86 tests green (12 new pi4b_hdd tests)

### 6. Phase 4: Hardening (Complete)
> *Seal the forge against the neon rain.*

- [x] TLS certificate validation for all downloads (--proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 on all curl calls)
- [x] Rollback expansion: zsh, rust, argon phases register rollback actions
- [x] Lockfile: prevent concurrent installer runs (InstallerLock via nix::fcntl::Flock)
- [x] Signal handling: graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM (SignalGuard via signal-hook)
- [x] Filesystem forensics: verify_file_written() and sync_file() infrastructure ready
- [x] Wired lockfile + signal guard into orchestrator/phase_runner
- [x] 99 tests green (13 new: 3 lockfile, 1 curl_flags, 3 signal, 6 verify)

**Why sixth:** Built on a stable, tested, CI-gated foundation. Safety nets that
matter most when everything else is already working.

### 7. System Packaging -- AUR / .deb / .rpm (stretch goal)
> *Let the system's own courier deliver the blade.*

- [ ] AUR PKGBUILD for Arch users
- [ ] `.deb` package for Debian/Ubuntu (via `cargo-deb` or manual)
- [ ] `.rpm` package for Fedora (via `cargo-rpm` or manual)
- [ ] Add package builds to release pipeline

### 8. TUI Rendering via Ratatui (stretch goal)
> *The forge works. Now make it glow.*

- [ ] Replace indicatif progress bars with ratatui terminal UI
- [ ] Phase-by-phase progress with live log tailing
- [ ] Interactive mode: phase selection, profile picker
- [ ] Error display with context and advice rendering

## Guiding Principles
- **Gates before gold**: CI lockdown and testing infrastructure come before features
- **Stamp before ship**: Tagged releases before distribution changes
- **Test before extend**: Driver harness before new phases
- **Foundation before facade**: Core stability before TUI polish
- **Green before merge**: `work` branch only merges to `main` when fmt + clippy + test pass
