# once_cell (RUSTSEC-2024-0381) is flagged as "unmaintained" because the
# author considers it feature-complete and recommends std::sync::OnceLock for
# new code. We no longer depend on it directly; it remains only as a transitive
# dependency pulled in by tracing-core, tempfile, and console (indicatif).
# Ignoring until those upstream crates drop the dep.
