# 🐉 SHAFT B: Retro Theme & Wallpaper Integration
> **Strategic Mining Plan**  
> *“The walls should paint themselves, and the terminal should glow with the runes of our ancestors.”* — Bard 🍻

## 📜 Project Summary (The Dragon’s Dream)
Integrate the BBC/UNIX retro-futuristic theme (i3-gaps + Kitty) and the wallpaper downloader into the MASH Installer main flow! No more Hyprland—we’re going back to the mountains where the iron is strong and the i3-gaps are wide. Reorganize the TUI journey for a logical ritual: Detection → Profile → Options → Themes → Software → Install. 🐉🎨

## 🏗️ The Integration Phases (The Five Days of the Forge)

### 1. Phase 2 - Core Integration (Day 1)
- **Quest**: Add the wallpaper downloader to the software tiers!
- **Quest**: Add the retro theme to the software tiers!
- **Deliverable**: The installation logic must hold firm, and the build must be green as mithril! 🟢

### 2. Phase 3 - Theme Integration (Day 2)
- **Quest**: Dependency checking for the i3/Kitty auto-install.
- **Quest**: Create the configuration deployment logic!
- **Quest**: Retire the Hyprland references to the old archive. 📦
- **Deliverable**: The theme installation ritual must be solid as stone. 🏔️

### 3. Phase 4 - TUI Reorganization (Day 3)
- **Quest**: Implement the new theme selection menu in the Ratatui cockpit!
- **Quest**: Reorder the menus for a logical flow—Detection first, Install last.
- **Deliverable**: The user experience must be smooth as a well-poured dram. 🥃

### 4. Phase 5 - Testing & Polish (Day 4)
- **Quest**: Test on the Raspberry Pi 4B! 🥧
- **Quest**: Verify the memory usage—no bloated code in our forge! 🚫
- **Quest**: Test the wallpaper download and error handling. 🎨
- **Deliverable**: The changelog must be inked and the docs updated. 🖋️

## 📦 Components Ready (The Artifacts)
- ✅ **Wallpaper Downloader**: 8 categories, 6000 images, and first-boot mode support! 🌍

## ⚠️ Blockers (The Dragon’s Snores)
- 🔴 **Wallhaven API Key**: We need the secret key before production deployment! 🔑
- 🟡 **Integration Time**: 5 days estimated, but time flies when you’re drinking ale! ⏳
- 🟡 **Pi 4B Testing**: We need a fresh machine to test the full ritual. 🥧
