# HISTORY
> **Neon Chronicle (Whimsical polish)**: This volume is what the drunken dwarf bard scribbles while the forge crackles—a neon-leather journal bound with plasma runes, tuned for tankard readers who crave math, mythology, and metal.

**Preface (Handwritten, in hurried cursive):**  
“I grinned as the terminal flickered to life. The glow cast glyphs across my beard, and a thousand neurons fired off in my brain like the motherboards of old. This is the ledger of Mash-Installer—each page a verse from the forge while the rails outside still hummed with plasma.”

## Chronicle I – The Forge Awakens  
The first verses tell how the crew pried apart the monolith, how D-03 sat patient inside `PhaseRunner`, and how we taught a thousand dwarves to sing one dry-run chant. `run_or_record()` became the single portal so deporting `if dry_run` everywhere felt as silly as tossing a keg into a reactor. The helper surfaces calmed, registry entries obeyed their `PhaseGate`, and the bard noted the rhythm: record every action, queue every rollback, and let warnings dance in the margins.

**Margin note:**  
> “I yanked the rogue `if dry_run` and the forge snickered; one gate to rule the dry runs, no duplicates allowed.”

## Chronicle II – The Neon Hymn  
Phase 2 became a long ballad—`runner` and `registry` knew their stanzas, `PhaseContext` sang metadata, and `InstallationReport` turned into a choir that `installer-cli` could finally hear. Pi detection helpers answered questions like “is it a Pi?”, “which generation?”, and “does it worship USB 3.0?” while `PackageSpec` carried intent flags and profiles. The bard watched the CLI, the docs, and the testing rituals breathe through `fmt`, `clippy`, and `cargo test`, and he whispered to the margins that there’s no place like `127.0.0.1`.

**Margin scribble:**  
> “A thousand dwarves hauling plasma ore couldn’t have made the registry sing as cleanly as the new metadata does now—each output a rune, every event a beacon.”

## Chronicle III – The Pause Before Pi  
The ledger now glows “Phase 2 complete.” Phase 3 (Pi 4B HDD) waits in the wings like a quiet dragon. The bard will not raise the curtain until the `InstallationReport` contract, CLI/TUI observers, `PackageSpec` gating, and the toolchain trio (`rustfmt`, `clippy`, `sccache`) stay steady.  
Every line here is a promise: map logs remain updated, the ABB/KCS/ABT/ABD creed stays etched, and the dragon’s snark will calmed before we ride the Pi rails again.

**Margin footnote:**  
> “Hold the ledger here—ink the saga, keep the report clean, and only when green runs stack will Phase 3 heat up.”
