# 🌌 Mash-Installer: The Over-Engineered Pi 4 Setup Wizard

Welcome to the **Mash-Installer**! Are you trying to boot a colossal 4TB external HDD on a tiny Raspberry Pi 4? Do you want your terminal to look like it belongs in a cyberpunk hacker movie? You've come to the right place. 💾✨

This script is highly optimized for the **Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB)** running off a USB 3.0 HDD. It brings the magic of Nerd Fonts, detects if you're an Arch Linux enjoyer ("BTW..."), and offers to summon Hyprland for you before dropping into a beautiful, Ratatui-powered TUI installer.

### 🚀 One-Shot Magic Install
Don't read, just execute. Run this in your terminal to begin the whimsy:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drtweak86/Mash-installer-/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
